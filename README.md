# Thirty Dollar Tools

This project contains tools related to the 
[Thirty Dollar Website](https://thirtydollar.website/) 
that help the creators to make better and more complex covers,
and the users to have more fun experiencing _"particle accelerators"_ 
and public covers.

## Projects you're most likely going to be interested in: 

## Thirty Dollar Visualizer

The **Thirty Dollar Visualizer** is a tool that replicates the **Thirty Dollar Website's playback**.
It plays compositions using multiple CPU threads allowing it to
achieve much higher note density and performance, than the website can achieve.

[More info about the visualizer here.](ThirtyDollarVisualizer/README.md)

## Thirty Dollar Converter

The **Thirty Dollar Converter** is a tool that perfectly 
outputs a Thirty Dollar Composition to a WAVE audio file.

The only limitation is your system's RAM capacity and 
the time you can leave your device powered on.

[See more info about the visualizer here.](ThirtyDollarGUI/README.md)
